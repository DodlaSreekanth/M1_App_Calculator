# Requirements

The Calculator should contain 0-9 numbers.

The Calculator must contain Addition,Subtraction,Multiplication and Division

## Introduction
 
A basic calculator is sometimes referred to as a 4-function calculator

A calculator is a machine which allows people to do math operations more easily. For example, most calculators will add, subtract, multiply, and divide.



## Research
 We had Researched on how to build and how the calculator can be customer oriented.


## Cost and Features and Timeline

The cost of the calculator should be low as well as it should contain all the basic features.


## SWOT ANALYSIS

Calculator are long-lasting, and they have almost all kinds of calculators such as basic, scientific, graphing, financial etc.

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
   
The First solid state electronic was created by Blaise pascal.

## What:

 A Calculator is a small electronic device used to perform various arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division. It makes our calculations easier and faster. It is a portable device that can use anywhere to perform simple mathematical operations

## When:

## Where:

Calculator was developed by intel for the japanese calculator company busicom

## How:

Calculation is being able to perform all four airthmatic operations with minimal human interaction.


# Detail requirements
## High Level Requirements:

It should contain **ADDITION,SUBTRACTION,MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION**


Status:All the other Implementations will be done at later Part.


##  Low level Requirements:

It should contain numerical values from 0-9
